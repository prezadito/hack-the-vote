## Elevator pitch
A combination of _Reddit_ and _Github_ for contributing to _public policy_.

## Problem statement
A lack of poltical participation outside of general elections and peaceful preotests.

## Inspiration
India's Parliament, and how they use twitter to gauge the opinion of their constituency.

## What it does
This new platform will provide a _curated newsfeed_ of public policies being proposed and passed in the user's respective _political district_. Users will be able to upvote/downvote bills, and give a concise reason for their support/opposition/concerns, which other users will be able to vote on as well. Future features will allow the user to 'fork' legislations, create edits, and submit 'pull requests.' 

## Technology used
Using open data from NYC Data portal, and building on top of a Django/python framework with bootstrap and jQuery for front-end functionality.
